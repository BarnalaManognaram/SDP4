  Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire, which stretched across Kashmir in the north to Deccan Plateau in the south and Afghanistan and Balochistan in the west to Bengal and Assam in the east. He seized the Macedonian territories and conquered the eastern territories of Alexander’s general Seleucus making his territory even larger.
Maurya was one of the most important rulers in the history of India who is credited with unifying small independent states in India to form a large single kingdom under one administration.
A young Chandragupta Maurya destroyed the Nanda dynasty, which ruled most of northern India. This was quite an achievement for a 20 year old.
Chandragupta Maurya was born in 340 BC in Bihar, and was guided by Chanaka, a great Brahmin economics and political science scholar, who later became his mentor. Details of his birth parents are uncertain- he is said to have been born to a Namda Prince and his maidservant Mura, or that he was from the Moriya tribe of Peacock tamers.
As already established, Chandragupta Maurya conquered most of the Indian subcontinent, establishing one of the largest empires ever seen in India’s history. He is known and honored for this feat. His son Bindusara succeeded him after he abandoned his throne and converted to Jainism. Maurya travelled to Shravanabelagola, a famous religious site in south India where he meditated and fasted to his death in 298 BC.

  The spread of Buddhism in many parts of the world is credited to Emperor Ashoka who was the third ruler of the Mauryan Empire. He was also known as ‘Ashoka the Great’ as he ruled almost the entire Indian subcontinent. He focused on expanding his empire continuously. His reign is considered one of India’s most glorious periods.
Ashoka went on and on with his conquests but had a turn around after his bloodiest and most lethal one at Kalinga- it left him shattered and changed him from a fierce vengeful ruler to a peaceful and non-violent emperor. The battle of Kalinga left 100,000 soldiers and civilians dead and more than 150,000 deported.
Today you will find telltale signs of Ashoka’s legacy in India- you will see places of meditation called stupas across his large empire, pillars, and the Ashoka Chakra inscribed on many of his relics.
Emperor Ashoka was born in 304 BC near Patna to the second emperor of the Mauryan Dynasty, Bindusara and Maharani Dharma. Being born into a royal family gave him exposure to some training he wouldn’t otherwise have had- he was good at fighting and hunting. He also received royal military training.
His ascension to the throne was rather gory and unconventional- he had to kill his 99 brothers to claim the throne which was fiercely contested among them when his father died.

  The world has Emperor Shah Jahan to thank for giving her the magnificence that is the Taj Mahal. The emperor constructed the ivory white marble mausoleum in memory of his wife the empress Mumtaz Mahal who died during childbirth. Shah Jahan was known for his love for architecture.
Emperor Shah Jahan was the fifth and greatest Mughal Emperor of India, from an impressive lineage- His father was Emperor Jahangir while his grandfather was Akbar the Great. He was the third born son and it was unlikely that he would be the heir to the throne. However it had been predicted that he would be emperor. Jahan kept off politics for a long time, but his interest gradually grew. He eliminated all contenders and became close to his father who named Jahan emperor upon his death.
Emperor Shah Jahan took to the throne and embarked on tactics to expand his vast empire. For someone who once had no interest in politics, it’s uncharacteristic that Shah Jahan grew impatient for the crown and attempted to overthrow his father. He however didn’t succeed.
Shah Jahan was also keen on ruling for as long as possible. He thus permanently eliminated his very own brothers and nephews so that he could rule unopposed! The emperor succeeded at expanding his territories considerably.
Shah Jahan was a patron for arts and had the Mughal Empire become a rich center of arts, crafts and architecture. His reign is credited with some of India’s most well-known architectural and artistic accomplishments such as the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid in Delhi, and the Shalimar Gardens of Lahore.
Emperor Shah Jahan died in his old age in 1666 and was buried at the Taj Mahal next to his favorite wife.
